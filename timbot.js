You don’t achieve the title of #1 by being a braindead player who sticks to one gimmick. There needs to be more respect for Hbox as a person. Right after the Axe vs. Wizzy grand finals at Smash Summit 8, when Hbox presented Axe the 1st place award, Hbox begins a heartfelt speech to Axe by saying “you know, I won this award last summit..” and starts breaking up. Immediately, Twitch chat starts saying “wow typical hungrybox making it all about himself.” Its absolutely amazing how everyone automatically assumes the worst and has never bothered to give the benefit of the doubt. If you go back and read /u/iamhungrybox comment on the Mango ama from 5 years ago, it’s really very awful how he’s been vilified in the community. Reminds me of Ken when he decided he wanted to retire. Everyone was rooting against him because he was the best, and he couldn’t handle the pressure. It’d be a fucking shame to see a talent like Hbox do the same. \nHbox if you see this, you’re fuckin sick at melee. Play the game for as long as you want to, but never feel pressured to keep going if its unhealthy. The internet and these communities suck ass when it comes to recognizing the pressure people in your position are in and the shit you’ve had to endure to get to where you are. \nYou’re great, man. Keep it up, proud of you.`,

Like suck my fucking dick if you think - no, honest to god - if you think, if you think, if you think, if you ever complain, if you're a Fox player and you ever complain about Puff, you need to reevaluate where you fucking stand. Because like, come on dude. That shit is not easy. Are you kidding me? I die from a grab up-throw up-air at like what, 45 on Yoshi's? If I land a rest on a platform, on a side-platform, at 32 percent I'm fucking dead? And people are giving me shit? Come on now, dude. No! No dude. I just got like wobbled. If you're gonna play this character with this infuriating infinite and I'm so done with ICs, oh dude, I just want, I hope every single game from here on out goes to 8 minutes. I hope every single time. And I'll taunt the fuck out of Sopo, every single time. I'm just, I'm so done with it, you know.`,
                    `Fuck this community man. All you guys ever do is look for ways to give me shit over any tiny thing. All 12 years of me playing Melee has been full of it. \nI’m literally mocked by my peers, my competitors, and community figureheads on a daily basis. \nLike what’s the point anymore`,
                    `For being the best player in the world, you're pretty immature. I think it's dumb you didn't even shake my hand after I beat you at NCR or even opt to take a picture with me and PPU for the results thread. \nMaybe I'm just bitter that you single-handedly turned an entire community against me and used your popularity to defame me and give people a completely wrong idea of me. It's weird that people on facebook still message me saying, "Dude you're actually a really nice person, everyone told me you were an asshole or something lawl". \nNow you've got the community in an even greater hold with your cult-esque fervor we call Mango Nation. You're the only person who can literally ride his own dick and people encourage you even more when you do it. If I was to even say a tenth of the self-promoting claims you make online, I'd have a brigade of hate lined up on top of the massive amount I already do. \nI don't have to go into how you treated me when I housed you and picked you up from the airport and the degrading and disgusting stuff you did and said about my mom. You think I don't remember? Not to mention saying similar things about my now ex-girlfriend. I really wanted to sock you in the fucking face so many times. \nBut I wouldn't stoop to that level. \nThe reality is, and the worst part is, that I have too much respect for you as a player. You've taken my favorite game and past-time to new levels and you constantly awe me with your advancing of the Melee meta-game. It keeps me on my feet and encourages me and countless others to keep playing. Everyone knows that, and no one can take that away from you.`,
                    `I have applauded your victories at EVERY tournament we've both been at. Every last once. I've shaken your hand and applauded you even after our sets. Even after Genesis 2, when you taunted me Game 3 as you were approaching a 4-stock on me. Even EVO, with the world watching. I took the approach of the bigger man, in hopes that maybe it would inspire you to do the same. And I was very wrong. \nThe thing is, now that the entire fighting game community knows of you, you have all the leverage you need to get your points across. You're the end-all for knowledge of the game and community. \nYou've gotten better about your attitude towards me, at least subtly. With Armada retired and with our tournament records in full display, I'm ranked #2 or #3 in the world behind you. Even still, you make it seem like I'm a joke for ever playing this game. \nAll I'd like is for you to just stop this nonsense and have at least an ounce of sportsmanship towards me. It's the least you could do after some of the things you've put me through that I won't mention. And don't just label off your actions as jokes. Yeah, you're a funny guy. But it's not nice being on the end of the stick for four years. \nMan up and be the representative this community actually needs.`,
                    `I was gonna do celebration stream, but uh, I thought it would be funnier if I created a new category on Twitch, called "DAN". So, "Doing Absolutely Nothing". So, if I was to go on Twitch on Tuesday, sit in front of my TV screen and literally absolutely nothing except stare in the webcam, for 3 hours, I wonder how many viewers that would get? Can we make a, new catgory? Can we make it uh, DAN? So if anyone wants to see me- if anyone wants to see me DAN on Tuesday, I think I'm gonna do it`,
                    `Y'know my goal here wasn't actually to win. It was for me to, uh, try, making friends again, with the top players in the community. It was like, for me to stop being the guy to talk so often and actually listen a little more. Honestly the best thing you can do for yourself I don't care what you do, just let go of your damn ego.`,
                    `hbox hit my car and laughed and when i tryed to call triple a he snapped my phone in half and yelled "LETS FUCKING GO"`,
                    `Someone asked me "like, great win, but why do you get so angry when that happens?" And I said "It's probably unhealthy, but I treat eveery single game here like life or death". Like I treat it like there's a revolver behind my head, and I have to win.`,
                    `Also this whole "ban wobbling" argument, w-when's the last time ICs won a supernational? I-I'lll wait. I can't think of one actually. It's weird that we wanna ban the 8th best character's number 1 tool to actually win, it's kind of strange to me. No-one likes getting wobbled - I hate getting wobbled, but if you are that salty that where everytime you get wobbled, if- every time you get wobbled, maybe don't get grabbed, don't get set up, maybe just get good for once in your life and actually stop blaming the fucking character.`,
                    `I'll tell the story. I was just a fan who was excited to meet and challenge Hbox to a $5 puff ditto best of 5 on dreamland. In the middle of game 1 he punched me in the liver and walked off with my wallet and JP White controller. Now I have to play melee through a straw.`,

                    `I was actually a mod on Hbox's twitch for a while- I met him at the Evo pool party and offered to buy him a drink, after I handed him the drink he turned his back on me mid-sentence and started talking to crunch instead`,
                    `I saw Hungrybox at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. \nHe said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” \nI was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. \nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. \nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.`,

                    `heard Hbox literally sees Jiggs backair as a metaphor for his penis and imagines himself pounding furry fox buttholes for days`,
                    `Hbox was behind me in line at Chick-Fil-A a few months ago. I was just waiting to be served when I heard some commotion behind me. I turn around to see Hbox walking in the door. "Hey, do y'all mind if I cut to the front of the line? I'm kind of in a hurry." Of course everyone agrees and he walks up to the counter. He orders 20 fucking chicken sandwiches. 20. I was still in shock from seeing him, but I try and strike up a conversation while he waits for his food. \"S- so, how do you feel about Chick-Fil-A and the gay rights controversy.\" He turns to me and says \"motherfucker, I come here BECAUSE I hate the gays!\" I'm stunned as the cashier brings Hbox his food. He picks up the tray, slams it on the ground, yells \"CLEAN IT UP\" at the cashier and walked out.`,

                    `Every single tournament Hbox wins, I always immediately check these threads to read every angry post. It's like crack to me. I can not get enough of this. \nIt's like you people don't realise just how amazing HungryBox really is at this game. \nYou are so simple-minded that you can't fathom that ''muh tech skill'' isn't all that Melee has to offer. Hbox has a deeper understanding of the game than any other player. His spacing and mindgames are simply off the chart when it comes to pure depth. \nAll these people playing literally the most OP character in the game can't do shit against Hbox's smart play. He's literally picking all of them apart and doing so much mental damage that they start second doubting themselves and throwing games. That's some powerful play. \nI love watching Melee. Not only do I get to see my all-time favourite player destroy everyone, but I also get to see you faggots bitch and whine about what's essentially a mid tier. Keep crying though, but it won't change anything. \nGood games, Hbox! Will be rooting for you next time as well. Not that you'll need it. Wouldn't expect anything less from the #1 ranked Melee player!`,
                    `And this weekend a miracle happened. I sat down to play Armada, I blinked, and my goal was suddenly behind me. A glass trophy in my hand with the official title written on it. Cameras flashing. Overwhelming emotion, disbelief, euphoria, and relief. Out of nowhere I played the best I have in my life while coming from losers. \nThe outpouring of congratulations I received was more than I ever would have imagined. It was a very beautiful experience to get to have that. And for that I'm very thankful. \nHowever, as expected there were some communities that don't see eye to eye on things. Like this subreddit, half of CFL Melee (my home community), and many others. And that's alright. That's reality. \nI'll never really understand why certain people don't realize what I put into this game. It might be the character I play. It might be my polarizing personality. But what I've learned is that you really can't focus on these things if you want to win. When I was on that stage I fell in love with Melee all over again. Just like I did when I attended my first very tournament in Florida and got 2nd to last place out of 40. \nI've had very difficult times reading things on this subreddit about me, but after this weekend I'm ready to move on from it. I proved to the world what I wanted to prove. I know I won't be able to change minds now or ever of that many people. But I respect your opinions and I encourage you to have them. I simply think it would be healthier for me to distance myself from it to continue performing at the level I want to. \nKeep playing Melee, keep cheering on your favorite player. Just love this game always. It's the best thing that's happened to me in a lot of ways, and I hope it's the same for you. \n-hungrybox`,
                    `Every time Hbox pulls through, and he does every time, I always make sure to check these threads immediately. You virgins are the source of some premium salt. \n \nKeep in mind that Hbox is playing Jigglypuff, essentially a mid tier character, in a meta where 50% of all top 100 players are maining Fox, which is Puff's absolutely worst MU sitting at 70-30 in Fox's favour. You're all just fucking scrubs who can't accept that HungryBox is the single best player to ever have touched a GC controller. This is undeniable facts at this point. \n \nNo one else has managed to prove again and again that my skill reigns supreme. Year after year of consistent wins over every single opponent. Taking tourney after tourney. \n \nStay mad, bitches. He'll keep winning.`,
                    `Hello /r/ssbm, \n \n I've read many, many, many things on this subreddit. A lot of them make me wonder about the backgrounds you all have had in competitive melee. My assumption is that most of you have at least attended/participated in one tournament and that you know a good bit about the history of the game. \n \nIf you have competed in the game, you're aware of what it's like to be in a hot seat. To have to think on the spot, adapt on the fly, cope with horrible losses, deal with salt, etc. \n \nMost of you (I think) understand what Melee is at its core. A phenomenal, unfathomably deep fighting game unlike any that's been created. It's why we love it and analyze it and have it as our passion. \n \nI've been competing for 10 years now. A lot of things have changed in this community. We almost didn't exist at one point when Brawl came out. We all had to pull a lot of weight to make sure we weren't forgotten and it's beautiful to see where we've gotten today. \n \nOnce Melee became a thriving, living community again it was a good time for me to focus on my own gameplay and not just the growth of the community. From 2013 to 2016 was probably my biggest era of growth both as a person maturing and as a Melee player. I obtained some much-needed discipline and learned more about myself from every event I attended. \n \nI yearned for the World Title. A massive goal for myself. And goals are something everyone here has - whether it's in Melee or outside of it. So I did everything I could to obtain that goal as soon as possible. I prioritized Melee for a summer, I got my best friend to be a sponsored coach for me, I became active in the Netplay community; Hell, I even took any chance to spread memes or information on social media about Smash. Because I love the community and I love what its given me.`,
                    `You know what, I admit it: I don't like HBox. At a fundamental level, I know it's not rational, but let me tell you what I do know: I don't like it when his slow, broken character dunks on my favorite players and kills my excitement. I don't like it when he grandstands during interviews and looks so fake and disingenuous. I don't like it when I have to watch everything I find awesome about this game get back-aired off stage or up-tilt rested time an time again until I don't feel anything anymore`,
                    `Yeah hfam we did it XD I'm literally DABBING on ALL the hbox haters in chat with my HFam right now LOL!`,
                    `Juan wakes up at 5:43 AM, before his morning alarm, ready to begin his typical Saturday morning ritual. Crunch is still asleep in the bed next to him, his body still warm where they touched. Juan violently shakes him awake yelling "LET'S FUCKING GO! IT'S TIME!" Crunch sluggishly rolls out of bed and says "Let... let me at least get ready first." Juan sits pouting on the edge of the bed while his coach uses the restroom, he hears a faint "What am I doing with my life...?" behind the closed door, but decides to ignore it.\n\nCrunch returns, and turns on the TV. Juan perks up, giddy with excitement. His adviser fumbles through loading up a PowerPoint presentation, but after a few minutes he's finally prepared. "Ready to start, Juan?" he says, and the answer is obvious. The first picture comes on the screen, a tweet from Mang0 at 2:23 AM the previous night.\n\n> got too wasted, not playing tomorrow\n> \n> good luck big leff\n> \n> ROFL\n> \n> GO EAGLES\n\n"FUUUUCK YEEEESSSS!" comes the inevitable scream from Juan, surely waking up the people in the neighboring hotel rooms. "FUCK THAT STUPID DRUNK IDIOT, NOW HIS FANS WI-"\n\n"Hooold up" Crunch cuts him off, "don't get carried away, there's more." Juan stares at the TV silently, his hands in a praying position. Crunch flips over to the next image. It's from Leffen.\n\n> feeling too sick to play, but might as well enter ultimate\n> \n> I'm tired of lying to you guys, the game is just easier. I'll definitely play melee at the next one, I promise.\n\n"YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! FUCKING FUCK!!!!!" Juan shouts, tears coming to his eyes. "THEY HAVE TO GIVE ME #1 NOW! Tell me they'll give it to me again, Crunch."\n\n"Well, we'll have to wait and see. It's likely." Crunch replies, already afraid of Juan's response.\n\n"What do you mean wait and see? Who can stop me now? This is the most important tournament left! I'll have too many wins!" Juan is talking more quickly, becoming pink in the face like his signature character. Crunch just silently looks at him, and goes to the final picture. It's Zain's twitter.\n\n> Feeling great, see you guys tomorrow!\n\nJuan instinctively, almost preemptively lunges forward off the bed and brings both his fists down, smashing the TV. "Aw, come on man, not again..." comes a voice from the doorway. It's The Crimson Blur.`];
